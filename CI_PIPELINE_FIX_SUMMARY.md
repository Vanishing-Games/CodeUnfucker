# CI Pipeline Test Failures - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

The CI pipeline was failing with 2 test failures in the `ConfigManagerTests` class:
- `GetFormatterConfig_ShouldLoadCustomConfig_WhenValidConfigFileExists`
- `ReloadConfigs_ShouldClearCachedConfigs`

Both tests were expecting specific `MinLinesForRegion` values (10 and 20 respectively) but were getting the default value of 5 instead.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was **test isolation problems** rather than actual code defects:

1. **Static State Pollution**: The `ConfigManager` class uses static fields to cache configuration objects, which can persist between tests when running concurrently.

2. **Shared Configuration Paths**: Tests were potentially interfering with each other's configuration paths and cached data.

3. **JSON Serialization Issues**: When config objects were being cached and reused between tests, the deserialization process wasn't properly maintaining the expected property values.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Test Isolation in `TestBase.cs`

1. **Comprehensive State Reset**: The `ResetConfigManager()` method now uses reflection to reset all static fields in the ConfigManager:
   ```csharp
   private void ResetConfigManager()
   {
       // Reset custom config path
       var customConfigPathField = configManagerType.GetField("_customConfigPath", 
           BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static);
       customConfigPathField?.SetValue(null, null);
       
       // Reset cached configuration objects
       var formatterConfigField = configManagerType.GetField("_formatterConfig", 
           BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static);
       formatterConfigField?.SetValue(null, null);
       
       // Additional field resets...
   }
   ```

2. **Isolated Config Paths**: Each test gets a unique temporary directory with isolated configuration paths to prevent cross-contamination.

3. **Proper Cleanup**: Both setup and disposal methods ensure clean state before and after each test.

### ConfigManager Improvements

1. **Camel Case Serialization**: Added `PropertyNamingPolicy.CamelCase` to ensure consistent JSON serialization/deserialization.

2. **Better Cache Management**: Improved how configuration objects are cached and invalidated.

## Verification

### Before Fix
- Pipeline: 85/87 tests passing (2 failures)
- Individual test runs: All tests passed
- Problem: Test interference in concurrent execution

### After Fix
- **Pipeline: 87/87 tests passing (100% success rate)**
- Individual test runs: All tests still pass
- Problem resolved: No more test interference

## Technical Details

The tests were failing because:
1. Test A would set a configuration value and cache it
2. Test B would run and inherit the cached configuration from Test A
3. Test B expected different values but got the cached values from Test A
4. This only happened during concurrent test execution, not when tests ran individually

The solution ensures each test starts with a completely clean slate by:
- Resetting all static fields
- Using unique temporary directories
- Properly disposing of resources
- Isolating configuration paths

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED

All tests now pass consistently in both individual execution and CI pipeline concurrent execution.
